            UoJCoders v4.0 is a 12-hour coding inter-university  competition. It's organized by the Computer Society and the Department of Computer Science at the University of Jaffna. The goal is to help students improve their coding and problem-solving skills, especially those studying computing. The event, inspired by IEEEXtreme, is open to all undergraduate students in Sri Lanka.

            The UoJCoders v4.0 competition is planned to be held on on August 23th and 24th, 2025, at the
            Department of Computer Science, University of Jaffna. Itâ€™s a 12-hour online coding challenge run
            through the <LinkButton link={"http://moodle.org/"} title={"Moodle"} /> , which uses a special tool called   <LinkButton link={"https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/"} title={"Virtual Programming Lab (VPL) plug-in"} /> plug-in
            along with a <LinkButton link={"https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-3.0.1/"} title={"a separate Jail system"} />.  This setup makes sure each participant works in a safe and private coding space. Even though the contest is online, participants must be physically present at the venue.
            The problems will focus on real-life situations, and students are encouraged to use the right data
            structures and algorithms to solve them.
